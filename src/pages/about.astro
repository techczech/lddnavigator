        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-ldd-gray-dark mb-4">About the Original Project</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          LDD Navigator was created as a resource for prison staff and professionals working with offenders who have learning difficulties and disabilities. It provides practical strategies, information about different conditions, and resources to help support people more effectively.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The original site was developed in partnership with leading organisations in the field of learning difficulties, including Dyslexia Action and the National Autistic Society.
        </p>

        <h2 id="site" class="text-2xl font-semibold text-ldd-gray-dark mb-4">How to Use This Site</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          This website helps you identify behaviours that may indicate a learning difficulty, understand what might be causing them, and find strategies to help. You can navigate the site in several ways:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <li><strong>By Behaviour:</strong> Start with what you're observing. Select a behaviour like "always late" or "can't follow instructions" to learn what might be causing it and what you can do.</li>
          <li><strong>By Difficulty:</strong> If you know or suspect someone has a particular difficulty like dyslexia or autism, start there to understand what to look out for and how to help.</li>
          <li><strong>By Strategy:</strong> Browse practical strategies that you can implement immediately to support people with various difficulties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-ldd-gray-dark mb-4">Why This Matters</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Research suggests that a significant proportion of the prison population has some form of learning difficulty or disability. Many have never been diagnosed and may not even be aware of their condition.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Understanding and accommodating these difficulties can:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600 mb-8">
          <li>Improve communication and reduce misunderstandings</li>
          <li>Help people engage more effectively with programmes and services</li>
          <li>Reduce frustration and challenging behaviour</li>
          <li>Support rehabilitation and reduce reoffending</li>
        </ul>
